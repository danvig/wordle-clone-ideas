#wordle-clone-ideas

I made this basic, unfinished, Wordle clone following an online tutorial.

I figured we could use it to get some ideas for our own Wordle project.

I also attempted to implement some of my own things like:
- Changing between Standard and Dark Mode
- Changing to Colour Blind Mode
- Determining if they've played today or not and adjusting the game

We'll obviously have to modify a lot of it because we can't blatantly copy it, I think?

But it's a good way to see how we should go about things.

We'll also need to further his, and my, functionality because they want things saved in browser storage and stuff, which is achievable, but needs some work.

I've commented the code so you can see what's his and what's mine and ideas and suggestions we can implement

Login is low priority obvs, but I reckon if we ever get around to implementing that, we can use JSON files to save user login data? But that's not important for now, just me blurting out ideas so I don't forget them.

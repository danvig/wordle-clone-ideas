# wordle-clone-ideas

I made this basic, unfinished, Wordle clone following an online tutorial.

I figured it could be used to get some ideas for my own Wordle project.

I also attempted to implement some of my own things like:
- Changing between Standard and Dark Mode
- Changing to Colour Blind Mode
- Determining if they've played today or not and adjusting the game

I've commented the code so you can see what's his and what's mine and ideas and suggestions we can implement
